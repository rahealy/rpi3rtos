# rpi3rtos
A Simple RTOS for the Raspberry Pi 3

This is an example of a task that counts up by six, prints A-F, sleeps for a specified time rounded up to the nearest kernel tick length then repeats.

This task runs at a priority of 1 (lowest). Demonstrates round robin task switching with task1 and task3.
